# Instructions

These are simple python scripts I've been using.

The Trek folder involves taking PDFs of expansion cards from the Star Trek CCG Continuing Committee and slicing out / formatting individual images for each card so they can be printed in MPC formatting.

The Star Wars folder involves doing the reverse: Taking a folder full of a set of SWCCG cards in MPC formatting and cranking out sheets of 9 cards that can be printed on a home printer (and then laminated or used as slips).

See the individual READMEs in each folder for more instructions.
