# CCG Conversion Tools

This is a React app (and legacy python scripts) to convert between print formats for cards, specifically in the ecosystems of Star Wars CCG and Star Trek CCG.

CCG cards are often stored in three formats:

* PDF sheets (of 9 cards) for home printing on, for example, an inkjet.

* Single card images with a wider border, for professional printing via the popular MakePlayingCards.com and its clones.

* Single card images that mimic the width and border of a classic card.

Those doing custom card creations often create their cards in one format alone. This app is designed to provide users the ability to convert between them.


## Current status

The app is presently constrained to just converting PDF sheets (in precisely the formatting of the Trek Continuing Committee) to MPC format.


## Legacy scripts

There are older python scripts I've used and made available for a long time. They have been moved to the python folder.


## Launching the site

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
